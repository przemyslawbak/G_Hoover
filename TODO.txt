move out _controlsService & _config from VM

ScrapService when collecting URL, take anchor instead of string

phrase builder replace " with \"

validate file txt + rows??

assembly -> iterate methods in class, but maybe not needed??

after STOP is still resolving captcha

var foundMethod = matchingMethods.Single(); <- exception in LogService

add debug only for logs

clean up logservice

track ControlsService calls on each btn click

delays in saving log.txt
